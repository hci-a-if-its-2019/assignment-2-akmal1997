# Sketching and Prototyping
Using the information in the results of Assignment 1 for what is good and bad about the UI for designed tasks, we are going to make **Sketches** and **Prototypes**. These sketches and prototypes will lead to better design in Assignment 3. The prototypes will be then tested through a usability evaluation followed by design revision in Assignment 4.

## Part A: Sketches
Sketch at least **3 (three)** different UIs for the functions you are targeting. These three interfaces should be _dramatically different_ in terms of design directions. For example, they can be with different organizations of what functions on each screen or using a different layout of the icons, widgets, and menus on the screens. If you want, you can also incorporate non-on-screen UIs: physical buttons, gestures through motion sensors, etc.

You need **not** sketch the whole interface. It is not necessary for the sketches to have every function or every function in detail, but there should be enough to show off your general idea. **Be creative!** Draw your idea and label a few of the widgets so we can tell your intent. The goal is to have at least 3 good UIs in *interesting* ways. Sketches should be done on paper with pens and/or pencils (do not use a computer).

### 1. Scan/Photo of Sketches
```
Be sure to label the different versions so you can differentiate them in your discussion. 
If you choose to take a picture of your sketches, please make sure the texts are readable.

### 2. Version Differences
```
2.1 Original
User can easily buy something without login and using fake identity

2.2 Sketch 1
More functionality added to the webshop. Such like the requirement to login to access for ordering things and the name checker (But, you don't put your SK ID since your SK ID is your username on login. And there is a name checker so, you cannot put a random name to the order form (Example: Your name is Abdul Dwipangga. You just only put "Abdul", "Dul", "Dwi", "Pangga", "Dwipangga", "Abdwip", and "Dwip" (Because of the limitation on the name only one word). You cannot put a fake name like "Adudul", "Utt", "Denise Keller", or "Sasuke" (Just like the choosing the name of your email if you register on ITS official mail or mail2.its.ac.id), and the warning of out of stock item

2.3 Sketch 2
The content same like Sketch 1, but i try to seperate the top navbar from the main page (Because of Sahabat Kereta Web Shop top navbar is same in all pages) and with seperate subdomains (Example: Sahabat Kereta Official Website is sahabatkereta.or.id, and the shop is shop.sahabatkereta.or.id)

2.4 Sketch 3
With more sophisticated UI, using float dialog, and some background and animations on backside

```

### 3. Selected Sketch
```
I choose Sketch 2. Because, it's more user friendly and more less data to consume (Assume all the users don't have a fast internet connection or limited data quota). And then, the sketch 2 just only modified the original and add the strength to not using fake name or buy an out of stock item
```

### 4. Design Rationale
```
Based of contextual inquiry, the developer must position himself as users (Especially the users that never or seldomly used an e-commerce before including the big e-commerce in Indonesia too). After that, the developer must listening a feedback from users. Because, the user will happy if the developer can develop the software that users want (Like simpler UI, easy to use, The item cannot bought by non members, etc)
```

## Part B: Assumptions
### 1. Hardware
```
Operating Systems: Windows
Physical Input: Mouse, Keyboard, Touchscreen
Screen Resolution: 1366x768 or higher
Screen Size: 11.1 inch
Computer with this specifications:
- Intel Celeron Bay Trail
- 4GB RAM
- 500GB HDD
- Windows 10 Home
Internet Speed: Up To 1 MBPS (using tehtering)
```
### 2. Users
```
1. Can using computer
2. Sahabat Kereta Members
```

## Part C: Prototypes
We will work on this part together during the class on **March 22nd, 2019**, 10:00 AM - 12.30 PM. Therefore, prior to the class please complete all the above parts (A & B) beforehand accordingly.
